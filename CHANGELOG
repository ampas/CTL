Version 1.5.3:
  * added Nuke_CTL

Version 1.5:
  * added OpenEXR_CTL, ctlrender
  * changed build system to Cmake
  * updated CTL libraries with features previously only avialable to ctlrender
  * ctlrender now uses official CTL libraries
  * ctlrender now uses single precision buffer and allows for 32 bit float operations
  * added ability to read and write 32 bit OpenEXR and TIFF files from ctlrender
  * added ability to specify OpenEXR compression method from ctlrender
  * added ability to write ACES files (SMPTE 2065-4) from ctlrender when   
    optional aces_container library is installed
  * added ability allowing for loading CTL modules directly from memory
  * Bug fix: update to CtlSimdInst.cpp to resolve streaks that occur in 
    some images
  * Bug fix: dpx::fb::alpha function no longer iterates past end of data
  * Bug fix: fix memory leak

Version 1.4.2:
  * Bug fix: x[y] = z overwrites the entire array x if x is
    varying while y and z are uniform.
    (Florian Kainz)
  * On Windows, paths in the CTL_MODULE_PATH environment
    variable are now separated by ";" instead of ":"
    characters.
    (Florian Kainz)
  * Bug fix: incorrect CTL code crashes the CTL Ñ–nterpereter
    (Florian Kainz)
  * Bug fix: initializing an element of a static CTL array with
    FLT_MIN or FLT_MAX throws a C++ exception (Florian Kainz)

Version 1.4.1:
  * Fixed build problem on Windows: build failed to create the
    IlmCtlSimd/halfExpLogTable.h header file.
    (Eric Wimmer)
  * Removed Windows .suo files from distribution.
    (Eric Wimmer)

Version 1.4.0:
  * Bumped DSO version number to 2.0
    (Florian Kainz)
  * Bug fix: multi-threaded execution of CTL programs caused
    segmentation faults and bad_alloc exceptions
    (Florian Kainz)
  * Added new functions to the standard library:
      3x3 matrix multiplication, addition and inversion
      3x3 and 4x4 matrix transposition
      1D lookup table with explicit x,y pairs and linear interpolation
      1D lookup table with explicit x,y pairs and cubic interpolation
      1D lookup table with regularly-spaced entries and cubic
      interpolation
    (Florian Kainz)
  * Added new ctlversion statement (Florian Kainz)

Version 1.2.1:
  Installation Tuning
  * corrected version number on dso's  - now 1.0
  * Separated package's LDFLAGS and LIBS flags so that test programs
  can link with static libraries properly
  * eliminated some warning messages during install
  (Andrew Kunz)

Version 1.2.0:
  * Reorganized libraries for general release
  * Bug fix: parsing of expressions with commas is stricter
    (Andrew Kunz)
  * New build scripts for Linux/Unix
    (Andrew Kunz)
  * New Windows project files and build scripts
    (Kimball Thurston)

Version 1.1.0:
  * Bug fix: Scattered-data interpolation did not interpolate
    smoothly between the given data points.
  * Bug fix: file IlmCtlSimd/CtlSimdReg.cpp did not compile on Windows.

Version 1.0.2:
  * Bug fix: FunctionArg::setDefaultValue() had unexpected side-effects.
  * Bug fix: log_h(+infinity) returned NaN instead of +infinity
  * Some operations on varying operands are faster.
  * Added new built-in functions:
      float log10_h (half x)  a faster version of log10(x)
      float pow10 (float x)  returns pow(10,x)
      half pow10_h (float x)  a faster version of pow10(x)
    The sample transforms in directory exrdisplay_ctl now
    call log10_h() and pow10_h().

  * Added missing IlmCtlMathTest directory.

Version 1.0.1:
  * Fixed code that compiled with gcc 3.x but not with gcc 4.x.
  * Bug fix: the size operator for a variable-size arrays
    sometimes incorrectly returned zero.

Version 1.0.0:
  * Initial release (only to AMPAS File Format Committee)


--------
OpenEXR_CTL Changes prior to CTL 1.5
Future versions of OpenEXR_CTL will be part of the CTL package and not 
have independent version numbering

Version 1.0.1:
  * Removed Windows .suo files from distribution.
    (Eric Wimmer)

Version 1.0.0:
  * Bumped DSO version number to 2.0
    (Florian Kainz)
  * Moved some .ctl files from the OpenEXR_Viewers to the
    OpenEXR_CTL package, changed naming conventions for
    image channels to match upcoming paper.
    (Florian Kainz)
  * Added support for multithreaded execution to function
    ImfCtl::applyTransforms(), added command line option to
    enable multithreading to exr_ctl_exr and exrdpx.
    (Florian Kainz)
  * Added exr_ctl_exr, a program that reads an OpenEXR file,
    applies one or more CTL programs to the pixels, and
    stores the result in another OpenEXR file.
    (Florian Kainz)
  * Installation Tuning :
    - corrected version number on dso's (libtool) - now 1.0
    - Separated package's LDFLAGS and LIBS flags so that test programs
      can link with static libraries properly
    - eliminated some warning messages during install
    (Andrew Kunz)

Version 0.9.0:
  * initial release
  * New build scripts for Linux/Unix
    (Andrew Kunz)
  * New Windows project files and build scripts
    (Kimball Thurston)
