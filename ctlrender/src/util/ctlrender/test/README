The BarsColor.pdf is a postscript file containing the SMPTE HD bars, normalized
to a 0.0 to 1.0 range (from -0.02 to 1.0). The original bars (Bars.ai) was
saved as a PDF, and then the PDF hand edited to set the actual color values.

Right now our test script doesn't deal with actually verifying the results, it
just goes through and generates the test images.

TODO: Get CTL scripts to handle conversion in and out of EXR so that can be
tested.
